title: Editor vs Writer

Jack Dorsey has this powerful metaphor called "Editor vs Writer". He says that, as an effective leader, your role isn't to write more content—it's to edit better.

Keith Rabois explains it best here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU9RjIa4cXU" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU9RjIa4cXU</a>

Whenever, as an executive, you find yourself doing more writing than editing - you're doing it wrong. There's a fundamental problem with that person or team when you end up writing more than guiding and refining.

Now, with AI, people who are skilled editors will perform 10X better because now you have an intelligent tireless intern who will create ten solid first drafts for you.

Your comparative advantage will be to select and combine the best elements from all drafts, ask more insightful questions, identify weaknesses in arguments, reorganize content strategically, provide additional context - and add or edit whatever aligns with the overall strategy of your organization or life.

The leaders who master editing, the ones who can ask sharper questions, spot logical holes, and weave disparate threads into a compelling whole, they will dominate in an AI‑first world. 

Editing, not writing, will become the exponential multiplier.
